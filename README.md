# Portfolio Source Code!

Hello and welcome to the source code of my portfolio! My previous portfolio was created straight out of school using a wordpress template. I landed a job shortly after, neglected the site and eventually took it offline completely.

This new portfolio aims to do two things:

1. Show off the skills I have gained through my experience as a proffesional Software engineer.
2. Learn something new!

This portfolio will be using Nextjs as the framework for building out the portfolio. I am experienced in React and always wanted to explore SSR (Server side rendering). I will be using TypeScript as the main "language" for this. Something new to me, I am very experience in JavaScript but have heard wonderous things about TypeScript. I don't imaging this will be too difficult seeing as TypeScript is built on top of JS. Lastly, I will be using tailwind for the styling component of this project. Over the last couple years I have saved a ton of time using pre-styled components from libraries such as MUI, ChakraUI and Bootstrap react, I want to go back to basics and see just how rusty my css has gotten over the years. Tailwind aims to be a "utility first" library.

I am excited to learn these new things building this portfolio!
